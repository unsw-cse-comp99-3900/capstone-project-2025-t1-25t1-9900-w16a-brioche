# Utils Documentation

## Overview

Utility functions encapsulate common logic that can be reused across different parts of the application. They act as helper methods to perform tasks such as formatting, calculations, or data transformations.

## When to Use

- Use utils to centralize generic functions that are used in multiple modules.
- They can simplify your code by reducing duplication.

## Best Practices

- Organize utility functions into logical groups (e.g., date utilities, string utilities, etc.).
- Use absolute paths when importing utils to maintain consistency.
- Ensure that utility functions are pure and side-effect free when possible.

## Guidance

When adding new utility functions, ensure they are generic, well-documented, and placed in the appropriate location. Import them using absolute paths and adhere to the naming conventions established in the project.
