# Context Documentation

## Overview

Context in our application is used to manage and share global state or configurations, such as themes, user data, or settings, without having to pass props through multiple component layers. It provides a centralized mechanism that can be accessed throughout the application.

## When to Use

- Use Context when you need to share data or functionality across a wide section of the component tree.
- It is ideal for managing global state, theming, localization, or user authentication data.

## Best Practices

- Avoid overusing context; for complex or highly dynamic states, consider using state management libraries.
- Use absolute paths when importing context modules to maintain consistency.
- Encapsulate context logic in custom hooks for better reusability.
- Keep context providers focused on their intended purpose.

## Guidance

When working with context, always ensure that global data is managed in a maintainable manner. Create context providers and custom hooks as needed, and import them using absolute paths. Use context for shared state, but be mindful of potential performance impacts if used excessively.
