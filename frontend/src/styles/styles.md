# Styles Documentation

## Overview

Styles define the visual appearance of our application's components. This includes CSS, Sass, or styled-components, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the entire project.

## When to Use

- Use styles to customize the appearance of UI components and layout elements.
- They should be applied in a way that keeps the visual layer separate from the logic layer.

## Best Practices

- Organize your styling files logically and keep them modular.
- Use absolute paths when importing styles to avoid path-related issues.
- Follow a consistent naming and theming convention across the project.
- Leverage CSS preprocessors if needed for more organized code.

## Guidance for Interns

When working with styles, ensure you keep the styling separate from your component logic. Use absolute paths to import styles and maintain consistency across your project. Follow the project's design system and theming guidelines to ensure uniformity.
