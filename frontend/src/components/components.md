# Components Layer Documentation

## Overview

Components are the fundamental, reusable UI building blocks in our project. They are designed to be pure, stateless, and focused solely on presentation. They accept data and callbacks via props to render UI elements.

## When to Use

- Use Components when you need a reusable UI piece, such as buttons, input fields, cards, icons, etc.
- They should remain free from business logic; keep them pure and focused on presentation.

## Best Practices

- Maintain clear and consistent naming conventions.
- Document your components with PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces as applicable.
- Ensure proper styling techniques and theming.

## Guidance

When creating UI elements, start by building small, focused components. If you need to handle state or integrate with business logic, consider wrapping these components in Containers.
