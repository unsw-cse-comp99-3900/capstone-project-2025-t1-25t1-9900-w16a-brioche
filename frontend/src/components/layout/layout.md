# Layout Documentation

## Overview

Layouts define the overall structure and scaffolding of our application's pages. They establish common elements (like headers, footers, sidebars, and navigation) to ensure design consistency across different screens.

## When to Use

- Use layouts when you need to set up a reusable page skeleton that can be applied across multiple views.
- They are ideal for standardizing common UI regions and background structures.

## Best Practices

- Keep layout components generic and easily composable.
- Use absolute paths when importing modules to maintain consistency.
- Separate styling logic from business logic.

## Guidance

When developing or updating layout components, focus solely on the visual scaffold. Avoid embedding business logic in layouts; instead, delegate dynamic operations to Containers. Use this file as a reference to maintain a uniform structure across pages.
