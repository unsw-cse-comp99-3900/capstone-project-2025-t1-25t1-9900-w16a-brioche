# Routes Documentation

## Overview

Routes define the navigation structure of our application, mapping URL paths to components or pages to facilitate smooth client-side navigation. They are essential for controlling the user experience and managing view transitions.

## When to Use

- Use routes to structure your application's navigational flow.
- Define routes for each significant view or page in your application.

## Best Practices

- Keep your route definitions organized, using nested routes for complex navigation hierarchies.
- Always import components using absolute paths to maintain consistency across the codebase.
- Avoid embedding business logic within route configurations; keep them focused on navigation only.

## Guidance

When setting up or updating routes, focus on clear, maintainable path definitions that enhance user navigation. Use nested routes where necessary and ensure that your configuration only handles routing without any business logic. This helps keep the application modular and scalable.
