# Types Documentation

## Overview

Types include the type definitions used throughout our project. They provide interfaces, type aliases, and enums, ensuring type safety and clarity in data structures, component props, and function signatures.

## When to Use

- Use types to define clear contracts for data structures and component properties.
- They help catch potential errors early and improve code maintainability.

## Best Practices

- Maintain clear and descriptive type names.
- Organize type definitions logically (e.g., separate common types, API responses, and component props).
- Always import types using absolute paths to ensure consistency.
- Leverage TypeScript's advanced type features for robust and flexible code.

## Guidance

When working with types, always strive for clarity and reusability. Keep your type definitions well-organized, and make sure to import them using absolute paths. This will help maintain a clean and error-resistant codebase.
