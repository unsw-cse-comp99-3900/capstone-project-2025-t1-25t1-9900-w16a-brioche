# Pages Layer Documentation

## Overview

Pages represent complete screens or distinct sections of our application. They serve as the top-level layer in our UI architecture, tying together Containers and Components to form fully realized views.

## When to Use

- Use Pages when you need to assemble, route, or display a full view in the application.
- They are responsible for layout, navigation, and orchestrating Containers and Components.

## Best Practices

- Keep Pages focused on layout and composition rather than business logic.
- Delegate state management and data fetching to Containers, and UI rendering to Components.
- Use absolute paths when importing modules in pages to ensure clarity and consistency.

## Guidance

- When developing a new page, think about it as a blueprint that organizes Containers and Components. Start by setting up the layout of the page, then integrate any required Containers to handle the data and logic. Lastly, use Components to render the actual UI elements. Always adhere to the established project structure and import modules using absolute paths for maintainability.

When developing a new page, treat it purely as an assembly of Containers. Pages should focus exclusively on layout, routing, and composition, and must not contain any business logic. All business rules and data processing for each section should be fully encapsulated within their respective Containers. After establishing the page layout, import and integrate Containers that manage their own logic and state, and then use Components within those Containers solely for rendering the UI.
