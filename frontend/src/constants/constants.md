# Constants Documentation

## Overview

Constants are used to define values that remain static or are used throughout the application. They help centralize configuration and reduce hardcoding in the codebase.

## When to Use

- Use constants for values reused across modules, such as API endpoints, configuration settings, or fixed numeric values.
- They help maintain consistency and simplify updates.

## Best Practices

- Organize constants logically (e.g., API constants, UI constants, etc.).
- Use clear and descriptive names.
- Import constants using absolute paths to maintain consistency.
- Maintain a single source of truth for static values.

## Guidance

When working with constants, always refer to this file as your single source of static values. Ensure that any new constants follow the outlined structure and naming conventions, and import them using absolute paths.
